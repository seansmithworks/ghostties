/// Tests for D9 / P1-001 multi-window scoping in the row-click flow.
///
/// # Architecture
///
/// Multi-window scoping in the row-click v0 flow is achieved by **parameter injection**,
/// not by notification filtering inside `SessionCoordinator`:
///
/// 1. `TaskRowView` holds a `@EnvironmentObject var coordinator: SessionCoordinator`.
///    Each window creates its own `SessionCoordinator` and injects it into its SwiftUI
///    environment. There is no global `SessionCoordinator.shared`.
///
/// 2. When the user clicks a row, `TaskRowView` calls:
///    ```swift
///    RowClickRouter.shared.handleRowClick(task, taskStore:, coordinator:, workspaceStore:)
///    ```
///    The `coordinator` argument is the per-window instance obtained from
///    `@EnvironmentObject` — not a shared singleton.
///
/// 3. `RowClickHandlers` receives `coordinator` as a constructor argument and
///    calls `coordinator.startOrFocusSession(...)` directly. Because this is the
///    per-window coordinator, the spawn fires only in that window.
///
/// 4. `SessionCoordinator` does NOT observe task `status:` field changes. Status
///    changes drive lane migration only through `TaskFileWatcher.onChange → TaskStore
///    .recomputeLanes()` — a data-layer operation that doesn't spawn sessions.
///    Therefore there is no notification-scoping filter needed inside
///    `SessionCoordinator` for the spawn path.
///
/// # P1-001 context
///
/// `phase-4-ghostties-workspace-sidebar-review.md` P1-001 documents a notification-
/// scoping fix applied to `WorkspaceSidebarView` — keyboard navigation shortcuts
/// (Cmd+Shift+]/[) were filtered by `coordinator.containerView?.window`. That fix is
/// about keyboard routing, not spawn. The spawn path was designed with per-window
/// coordinator injection from the start and does not need an equivalent filter.
///
/// # Verification outcome
///
/// **The multi-window scoping filter is correctly implemented by design** (coordinator
/// injection) — no missing filter was found. The `SessionCoordinator` source does not
/// contain a status-flip notification handler that could cause cross-window spawns.
///
/// This test class documents the contract structurally and verifies it holds.
